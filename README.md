# PowerBI
My learnings and samples of PowerBI dashboards

- ##### This financial dashboard is using sample data from powerBI.  PowerBI has a lot of visualization and is great for end-users to consume data.  My experience using PowerBI is that it has many limitations when it comes to tabular robust reporting, but is great for simple visualization, charting tools especially for larger datasets.  Excel is great for more ad-hoc style reporting, advanced dashboards especially when it comes for highly data-driven executives and in-session discussions.  

- ##### Please reference the files for the powerBI file.
